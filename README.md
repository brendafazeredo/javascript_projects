<h1>JavaScript Projects</h1>

<p>Here are some JavaScript projects from my Cubos Academy's course: Software Development - back-end focused.</p>

<p>The exercises' language is PT-BR since the academy is a Brazilian one.</p>

<p>These are some basic exercises; to see even further, check out the repository named "javascrip_apirest_and_others".</p>
